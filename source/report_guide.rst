Project Report Guide
====================


Collaboration
--------------

You are free to discuss projects with your classmates. However, each project report
must be solely your own work: it must be written by you in its entirety, including
all Python code. Plagiarism of any kind (copying from other students, or permitting
someone to copy your work, copying from the internet etc.) will result at the minimum
in the failing grade on a report, and possibly in additional sanctions (an F grade for
the course, an academic disciplinary action etc.).


Using external resources
------------------------

You are free (and encouraged) to consult Python documentation and
other resources to better understand various tools we will be using.
You are not allowed to copy code you found online and use it in your reports.

In the narrative of a report you can insert a brief quote from some source if you
find it useful, as long as you provide a proper attribution. Quotes used without an
attribution are an instance of plagiarism. Long quotes - e.g. using a few paragraphs
from Wikipedia for the report introduction - will decrease the value of your report,
even if they are attributed.


Report grading rubrics
----------------------

Detailed rubrics which will be used to grade project reports are posted
`here <./_static/report_rubrics.pdf>`_.





Report Style Guide
------------------


Report introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A report must begin with an introduction section. It should explain the project
and the goals of the report in a way which is engaging and understandable to
person who does not take this course. While writing a report imagine that you
are creating a part of a portfolio that you will show while applying for a job
to demonstrate your skills.

The introduction of a report must not be limited to a list of tasks you want
to accomplish. While explaining the project use your own words, do not copy
the project description posted on this website.

Report conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final section of the report must summarize your results and conclusions.


Report organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beside the introduction and conclusions, the body of the
report should be logically organized into sections. Each section 
should have a meaningful title.



References
~~~~~~~~~~

If you used books, articles, websites etc. while preparing the report, they should
be listed at the end of the report.



Math formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use LaTeX to format all mathematical symbols and formulas.

   Example <./Report_guide/report4>



Code structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python code should be split into possibly short code cells that accomplish a single,
well defined task.  In particular, you should not define several functions in one cell
or define a function and execute it in the same cell.

You should explain (even if very briefly) the purpose of each piece of code. As a rule,
you should not have in a report two consecutive code cells without any text between them.

   Example <./Report_guide/report7>


Code sequencing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Python code in the report must be presented in such order that it can be read
and executed sequentially, from the beginning to the end of the report. For example,
you should not use a Python function in your report prior to defining this function.

   :maxdepth: 0

   Example <./Report_guide/report5>


Code comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code comments should be used to explain workings of the code.

   :maxdepth: 0

   Example <./Report_guide/report9>


Execution errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All code included in your report must work. Do not submit reports with execution errors.

   :maxdepth: 0

   Example <./Report_guide/report8>


Output size
~~~~~~~~~~~

Your report should contain only code output that serves some purpose
and that you expect someone to read. As a general rule, do not print more
than 30 lines of output unless you have a very good reason for it.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 0

   Example <./Report_guide/report1>


Output formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format code output in a way that makes it easy to read.

   :maxdepth: 0

   Example <./Report_guide/report3>


Graphs and plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graphs and plots must be well formatted. They should have titles and, if appropriate,  axis labels, a legend etc.

Notebook gallery
----------------

The files linked below were selected from among notebooks posted online by various
researchers and data scientists. The reports prepared for this class are **not** expected
be as long and extensive as most of these examples. What you should try to imitate is
the style: merging of the narrative with the Python code, organization of the content,
preparation of graphics, code documentation etc.
