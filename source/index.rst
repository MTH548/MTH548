| Bernard Badzioch
| **E-mail:** `badzioch@buffalo.edu <badzioch@buffalo.edu>`_
| **Office Hours:** Wed 5:00-7:00 PM


Prerequisites
-------------

This course assumes that you have some experience with programming in Python, and
with such Python libraries as matplotlib or numpy (although we will start the course
with a review of numpy). I will also assume that you are familiar with Jupyter Notebook:
code cells, markdown cells etc. If you have not used Jupyter Notebook before, install
the Anaconda distribution (see below), which Jupyter Notebook is a part of, and get
acquainted with it. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.


Learning Outcomes
-----------------

After taking this course you should be able to:

* Understand various common formats of data (csv, html, xml, json, SQL database etc.) and how to use them.
* Manipulate data using such tools as numpy, pandas, json, BeautifulSoup, SQL etc.
* Visualize data using matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.
* Apply some machine learning methods to analyze data.
* Describe and explain in writing results of data exploration and analysis.

Course Resources
----------------

**Laptop.** We will be writing code during all class meetings. For this reason you need 
to bring a laptop to each class. Any operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) is fine.

**Software.** We will be using the `Anaconda distribution of Python 3.9 <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads target="_blank">`_.
This is free software. Even if you have Python already installed on your computer you should install this
distribution since it includes Jupyter Notebook and several Python modules we will need.
If you have a previous version of Python installed, please upgrade it so you don't run into
possible compatibility issues.

**Textbook.** There is no required textbook. There are a lot of online resources (documentation
of Python libraries etc.) that may be helpful in this course. Some of them are listed on
the :doc:`Useful Links <useful_links>` page.

|UBLearns| will be used mainly for submitting project reports.

Grading
-------

There will be no exams in this course. Instead, grades will be assigned based on
the following components:

    * Project Reports 80%
    * Class Participation 20%


Project Reports
===============

One the main components of this course will be exploratory projects. You will be
working on them largely independently, using mathematical and computing tools.
The outcome of your work on each project will be a project report that you will
submit for grading.

Each report will be graded on the A-F scale. Extra credit (a grade of A+) will
be assigned for an outstanding work. Some projects will require more effort than
others. To reflect it each project will have a weight of up to 10 points,
with 10 points for more work-intensive projects, and fewer points for shorter
ones. The cumulative grade for all reports will be computed by:

1. converting the letter grade for each report into credits (A = 4.0, A- = 3.67 etc.);
2. multiplying credits for each report by the report weight and adding all these
   products;
3. dividing the resulting number by the sum of weights for all reports;
4. converting the number obtained in step 3 to a letter grade.

Reports will be submitted via UBLearns. The submission deadline will be 10:00 AM on Fridays.
Late reports will not be accepted. More information about project reports is posted
:doc:`here <report_guide>`.


Class participation
===================

Class participation credit will be based on two components:

**Class attendance.** You can earn up to 10% of the total course credit
for being present and on time during class meetings. You can miss two
class meeting without a justified reason. Each subsequent unexcused absence
will lower your participation credit by 2% (i.e. from 10% to 8% etc.).

**Weekly digest.** As a part of each homework you will be asked to submit
a short (2-3 sentences) writeup on your study from the previous week.
For example, you can write:

* what topics you have found interesting (or boring)
* what topics you have found difficult (or easy)
* how  you feel about the course
* anything else you want to share.

You will be also asked to a question (or questions) regarding the course.

You can receive up to 10% credit for these writeups. You can miss one
such assignment without loosing any credit, but your weekly digest credit will be
lowered by 2% for each subsequent missed assignment.

I may award extra credit to students who are especially active in the course.
