Weekly Digest 9
===============

**Guozheng asks:**

    During the class we find the math building location. But It show me there are 2 result. 
    One of them is the actual Math building, but other one is showing the city hall of Buffalo. 
    Just wondering why it will show 2 result.

The OpenCage search engine works similarly to Google web search. It tries to find the best matches 
for your search query, but  not all of these matches will give what you expect.

**Renjie asks:**

    For the secret zipped xml files in Microsoft Office, I didn't use the Microsoft Office on my 
    laptop, so I didn't got that part. It's that a problem, will we use such thing after?

This is not a problem. It was just an example showing how XML files are used. 


**Jeffrey asks:**

    Is there a simple way to combine a list of dictionary that have a similar key?

I am not sure that you mean.


**Amena asks:**

    I really enjoy doing the projects lately without the narrative but when will we go back to 
    research/narrative coding?

The next project will require a narrative.  


**Sean asks:**

    What other apis (if any) do you plan on covering?

We will be moving back to machine learning and then SQL, so most likely no more APIs.  


**Alexander asks:**

    Are there any other API's like the national weather one that you could recommend 
    for us to practice with?

If you search the web, you will find many list of APIs that are recommended for various 
purposes. `Here <https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis>`_ is one example. You can 
choose something that seem interesting and explore it.   


**Hannah asks:**

    Will the final project be similar to the other projects or are you planning something 
    larger and more cumulative?

There is no cumulative final project, all projects should be more or less similar 
as far as the required effort is concerned (except projects 4 and 5 which were intended 
to be shorter). 

**Miguel asks:**

    I don't have one this week

You should come up with something - this is a part of the assignment. 

**Sai asks:**

    How many more assignments can we expect?

We should have time for 2 or 3 more. 


**Max asks:**

    Was JSON created as a way to pass dictionaries between languages? It seems 
    like all fourth generation languages have a form of dictionaries but did 
    JSON come before that and if so what were its uses?

JSON format was proposed in 2001 and it was originally intended as a tool for passing 
data between web servers and a web browsers, not between languages. The dictionary notation 
that JSON uses was present in various languages several years before JSON creation. 
In particular, it was used by JavaScript (on which JSON is based) and by Python. 


**Temitope asks:**

    If time permits, I will love it if we can touch base with PyTorch


Given time I would include some TensorFlow (which provides similar tools as PyTorch), 
but I think we will not get there. 


**waleed asks:**

    Could we do more coding heavy reports?

Every report has a coding component. We may get to one more that will 
be purely computational one. 


**Houlin asks:**

    For a data analyst, if I have to choose one language to mastering, is SQL more 
    useful or python? Will you talk about some SQL in this class?

We will work with SQL in this class. In most cases a data analyst  needs to be familiar 
with more than one language, since different languages serve different purposes. 
For example, Python is a good tool for data analysis, but SQL is often needed to retrieve 
data from databases. 

**Darren asks:**

    Why would we choose JSON over xml or vice versa? Or what are the drawbacks of using either one?

JSON has been recently gaining popularity over XML because it is more concise - 
in general it takes less text to encode the same data with JSON than with XML. 
It is also usually easier to work JSON. On the other hand, XML has more features. 
For example, XML supports namespaces and JSON does not. For many applications JSON
will be a better choice due to its simplicity, but for more complex uses, XML may 
be preferred. 

**Matthew asks:**

    Is our time spent in the voice channel part of our participation grade or is it just our time 
    spent on the discord server in general?

I am measuring voice channel participation. Technically, you cannot "be present" on a Discord 
text channel - you can read or send messages there, but no one can see you on the server if you are
are only looking at a text channel. 

**Makhtar asks:**

    Are we marked absent if we leave discord before the end of the class time even though we finish 
    the assigned homework?

I will be reasonable in evaluating this. I expect though that in most cases this will be an easy call 
E.g. if I direct everyone to work on something on Discord during class time and someone does 
not show up at all, then there is not much to debate. 


**Justin asks:**

    N/A

This is not a question, and asking some question is a part of this weekly assignment. 


**Jonathan asks:**

    Will the final project be a sort of cumulative assignment? Or will it focus solely 
    on what we learned in the prior week?

There will be no cumulative assignment.
