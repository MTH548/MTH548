Weekly Digest 2
===============

**Miguel asks:**

    Does speed of our solutions matter if they are correct?

In general speed is not a priority, but you should use available tools to make
the code efficient. For example, running a loop over a numpy array to do a computation
that can be done with a vectorized function is not a good practice.


**Sindy asks:**

    Use half an hour of the class to answer questions. E.g.We took 40 minutes of class, then
    we use python by ourselves while Professor can answer questions. In this case we get to
    practice on time.

This is more or less how I would like to structure this class. For the first few
meetings I have been talking most of the time to get things started, but the goal is
to spend more time with everyone coding.


**Temitope asks:**

    Aside matplotlib and seaborn, I will love if we can be introduced to either PowerBI
    or Tableau as some other visualization tools. And when to know which data analysis
    is good for excel and that suitable for Python.

Power PI and Tableau are outside of the scope of this course. However, I will talk about
Plotly which has similar capabilities. We will use Plotly mainly as a plotting library,
but Plotly Dash is a tool for building interactive web-based interfaces for visualizing
and exploring data.

Anything you can do with Excel can be also done with Python, often more easily.


**Zhongyang asks:**

    How many times are we expected to work on this course?

I am not sure if I understand correctly what you mean, but if you are asking about
the number of projects then there should be 7-9 of them.


**Sean asks:**

    Will there be any discussion about run time complexity when it comes to these algorithms?

Probably not. The focus of the course is how certain tools for data analysis work and how
to use them. Issues with complexity, optimization etc. are interesting, but will not be our
main concern.


**Alex asks:**

    Will we be getting more ungraded exercises like from week 1 or will it be more like
    doing homeworkâ€™s and learning from them?

I plan to have more ungraded exercises.


**Waleed asks:**

    Maybe an example report from a previous iteration of the course to show us how to format
    a project report.

I will see if I can find something appropriate.


**Sai asks:**

    Can u explain the  k-nn part once again, as i still not have no clarity on this part.

We can talk after the class on Tuesday, it will be easier to clarify it in person.


**Jeffrey asks:**

    Do you recommend any websites that could help elevate our coding skills?

    Is it possible to give us examples of the inputs that goes into the function and what
    it should output?  Or a drawing demonstration of how the function should operate?


The best way to enhance coding skills is to code. We will go through several projects
and exercises in this course which should help with this. If you need help with some particular
Python library (say numpy) then reading the library documentation can help. Stack Overflow is
also great - most questions you may run into have been already answered there.

As for examples of input and output of functions, I gave it for the numpy exercises. I will try to keep
doing it in the future. I am not sure what you mean by drawing demonstrations, but please feel welcome
to talk to me. I am happy to listen to suggestions.


**Guozheng asks:**

    How do I make the reshape number if I don't know which scale is best for the nump array.
    In class we use 28*28.

How to reshape a numpy array, and if needs to be reshaped at all depends on a particular context.
The documentiation of the MNIST database specifies that images included in the database are 28x28 pixels,
and this is which we needed to reshape the arrays with images to this shape.


**Amena asks:**

    Will we have optional reports for extra points at the end of the semester?

No, but you can get extra credit (an "A+" grade) on each report for an outstanding work.

**Renjie asks:**

    Can you explain or do some example of "def()", I'm confused about the thing will be in the parentheses ,
    sometimes it will be only one thing such as "a" sometimes there will be multiple things such as "a,n"
    Is the number of things inside the parentheses are totally depends on what we need, like if it's needed
    can something like "def(a,b,c,d) exist?

The `def` keyword is used to define functions in Python. Since basic Python syntax is a prerequisite for this
course, I do not plan to go over it in class. If you need to refresh your knowledge of Python functions there 
are many good tutorials online, e.g. `this one <https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/>`_ .


**Matthew asks:**

    What is the most common mistake you see students make on the first project?

Poor writing -  some students submit reports that consist mostly of code, with just a few sentences of narrative. 
A good report needs to tell a story that somebody not taking this class can understand and appreciate. 
It does not mean that the writing needs to be very extensive, but it is supposed to guide the reader through 
the report. 

**Max asks:**

    Do we, as students, have access to a high power computing center at UB that we can use to run simulations and 
    speed up machine learning?

As far as I know students can get access to the computing resources of UB Center for Computational Research 
only if they they either work with a faculty member on some project or if the access is set up for a course 
they are taking. In MTH 448/548 we will not need that much computing power, a personal computer will be enough. 


**Darren asks:**

    I currently do no have a specific questions to ask. Thank you.

As I explained last week, asking a question is a part of this assignment. If you want to get 
full credit for weekly digest come up with something. 


**Elita asks:**

    Do we have to format references in MLA, APA, etc, or can we just link the websites?

If you want to reference a website, just link it. If you reference a book etc. you can format the citation
any way you like as long as it clearly identifies the source. 

**Jonathan asks:**

    I'm curious as to how the k-NN algorithm from project 1 is different from supervised learning (i.e. what else 
    is needed in conjunction with the k-NN algorithm that would make it the same as a real machine learning algorithm).

k-NN is a supervised learning algorithm, nothing else is needed to make it one. 


**Makenzie asks:**

    Nothing this week.

As I explained last week, asking a question is a part of this assignment. If you want to get 
full credit for weekly digest come up with something.
