Weekly Digest 5
===============

**Zhongyang asks:**

    For 3rd project : Baby names, Is there a good way to test our answers? Because we can
    use heatmap to check our results in project 1 and 2.

The baby names project is more open ended: you need to analyze the data in some way and
describe your analysis. Of course computations you make need to be correct.


**Sean asks:**

    This may have been answered before but I just wanted to know if you are incorporating
    webcam usage into our participation grade?

I talked about it briefly last week. I wil not alter course grades depending if someone
kept their camera on or off, but I would like you to have it on to get a sense of
participation and community in this remote setting. Consider it a matter of kindness and
respect.

**Darren asks:**

    For organizing the Jupyter notebook cells, I know that there is a way to move a cell up and
    down, but is there a way to move multiple cells at once instead of moving one cell at a time.

You can select multiple consecutive cells for example by first clicking next to a cell, and the
using Shift-J keys, which adds the next cells to the selection. Once the cells are selected,
the up and down arrows will move all of them.

**Makenzie asks:**

    I'm curious about web-scraping. Is there a way to pull information from the web directly into
    Python using Pandas?

Pandas function `read_html() <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_html.html>`_
reads data from html tables embedded in webpages. Getting non-tabular data requires more work.
We will go over web scrapping soon.


**Waleed asks:**

    Are we allowed to use libraries that we have used in the past which are outside the scope of this 
    course to do tasks quicker?

Yes, unless a project description specifies otherwise. 

**Guozheng asks:**

    What is the different between the concat and merge?

Concat simply adds additional rows or columns. Merge creates a dataframe using combinations 
of rows (or columns) from two dataframes, using some condition to determine which row should 
be combined with which.   

**Sindy asks:**

    During picturing clusters, does the star mark where the most cluster points concrete geometrically?

If you are asking about the code I provided, then the star was used for data processed 
by k-NN, not k-means and it marked a point whose label we were trying to predict. 

**Jeffrey asks:**

    Can you explain what are the key features of pandas library and what does pandas stand for?

The word "pandas" is derived from ""Python data analysis". I talked about key features of 
pandas in class, please review videos of lectures from week 4 and 5.  


**Renjie asks:**

    Have you considered that how many projects in total will be in this course? 

There should be around seven. 


**Matthew asks:**

    Will we be learning any methods of presenting data on maps in this course (e.g. 
    choropleth maps)? If not, can you recommend any resources for learning this independently? 
    I think it would be an interesting way to present some of the baby name data for project 3. 

I will be talking about visualizing data on Tuesday, I will include choropleth maps if time permits.

**Miguel asks:**

    I don't have any questions this week but I just wanna say this is one of my favorite classes!

I am glad to hear it, but do come up with some question, this is a part of the assignment. 


**Sai asks:**

    Where can I find exercises on this week concept, and practice for the baby project . 

I am not sure which week you are referring to. There are several exercises with pandas in 
week 5 notes. As for baby names, we will talk more about it in class. 

**Mohammedanas asks:**

    If we do get to learning about SQL, how in-depth are we gonna dive in to it?

I plan to cover some SQL, enough to write fairly complex queries. 

**Peter asks:**

    How long should the Baby names project be? There are suggestions for what to do, but 
    "Analyze some facets of this data" is a bit wide open for interpretation! 

It should be about as long as the previous two reports. Find some aspects of the data 
that seem interesting to you, and explore them. We will talk more about this project
this week. 

**Seungmin asks:**

    Will there be any extra credit or projects that will count towards extra credit in the future?

You can get extra credit on each report for work which goes beyond of what is 
expected. There will be no separate extra credit assignments though. 

**Elita asks:**

    How many more libraries will we be learning?

We will see several more. Some will be explored in greater depth, some we will just 
encounter casually.   

**Justin asks:**

    Results of project grade?

I am not sure what you mean. 

**Amena asks:**

    Do you recommend any other textbooks or readings that may help with the project 3 
    Baby names?

You don't need a textbook. You may search the web or check pandas documentation if you 
will need some additional pandas tools for your analysis.  

**Jonathan asks:**

    Will we touch pytorch or related libraries at some point this semester?

It time permits we may do something with TensorFlow/Keras.
