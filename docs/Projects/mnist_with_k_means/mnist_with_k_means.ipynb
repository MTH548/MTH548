    "An issue with the k-NN algorithm is that it can be slow if we have a big set of training data, and if this data is highly dimensional. The goal of this part of the project is to investigate two different ways of dealing with this issues using k-means clustering. One way is to reduce the amount of training data, and the second is to reduce dimensionality of data. \n",

    "2. For each digit 0-9 select all training images corresponding to this digit, and then use k-means to split these images into several (e.g. 100) clusters. Use centroids of these clusters as new training data for k-NN. This will make the amount of training data smaller, since every cluster of the original training data will be replaced by a single centroid. \n",
    "3. Investigate how the prediction accuracy and speed of k-NN using this new training data compares to the case when you use training data without clustering. Also, if you train k-NN using the centroid training data and then train it using the same amount of randomly selected training data is there a difference in the prediction accuracy?\n",

    "2. Use k-means to compute clusters for the training data. Then use these clusters to reduce dimensionality of both training and test data, and investigate how the prediction accuracy and speed of k-NN using the reduced data compares to the predictions done without dimensionality reduction. Experiment with dimensionality reduction done with different numbers of clusters and compare the results. \n",
